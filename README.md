				BINARY TREES
Trees are simply nodes connected together.
Binary tree is a kind of data structure used for storage purposes.
Each node of a binary tree can only have a maximum of two nodes called the children.
A simple binary tree consists of the ROOT, PATH AND CHILD nodes.
The root node is the node at the top of the tree. A tree can only have one root node and one path from the root node to any other node.
The path is the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
The child node is the node below a given node connected by its edge downward.
The child node is of two types - The LEFTCHILD and The RIGHTCHILD.
According to the Binary Search Tree Representation the rightchild node is the node with its
